            "On election night President Trump prematurely declared victory and claimed that the Democrats are stealing the election This is false nbsp Here s a quick FAQ to help you understand what is currently happening in the United States When will we get results Experts are predicting that it could take up to a week or more to get the final unofficial vote tallies in some states The NYTimes has a really helpful chart that explains what to expect in each state The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail in ballots including ballots from military service members which some states were not allowed to start counting until the polls close For example Pennsylvania did not start processing their mail in ballots until Election Day and may not finish counting them all until November 6th Keep in mind that we ve had historically high numbers of mail in ballots this year and counting them all takes time due to the robust security measures in place To dig into this even more we can look at Michigan and Pennsylvania Michigan As of 10 30am ET on 11 10 of votes are left to count and Biden has a small lead The bulk of the remaining ballots are in Detroit s Wayne County but the clerk there has not yet given a timeframe for when we can expect results Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is promising a much more complete picture of Michigan by the end of the day Pennsylvania As of 10 30am ET on 11 22 of votes are left to count We are unlikely to know the final count today because 1 Philadelphia its suburbs and Pittsburgh are still counting ballots and 2 ballots can still arrive by Friday if postmarked on Election Day though this is likely to be challenged at the Supreme Court nbsp But we ve never had an election where ballots weren t all counted on election night FALSE On election night experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available by the end of the week nbsp Okay but counting votes after election night will steal the election FALSE Ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day and many states require that they must be received by Election Day States have to count all votes Counting all the votes cast isn t stealing anything it s making sure that every vote is counted just like every other election nbsp What s the deal with Pennsylvania Why are so many people alarmed Experts anticipated a red mirage in Pennsylvania that would later be subject to a blue shift and it looks like that s what we re seeing right now You can read a really detailed explanation here Here s what s happening Pennsylvania counted the in person Election Day vote first and that vote favored President Trump as expected Mail in ballots are counted later and are expected to favor Biden This is why we saw Trump with a big lead on election night and a shrinking lead as of this morning You should expect to continue to see this shrink Simply put We need to wait for all the votes to be counted before calling the winner nbsp What about Arizona Arizona is interesting because it could actually experience a red shift Early votes were expected to favor Biden and over the course of the night the race has tightened While some media outlets have called Arizona for Biden we should keep an eye on it This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor nbsp Are mail in ballots rife with fraud No Mail in ballots are very secure Colorado is almost completely vote by mail and has some of the most secure elections in the country Check out this helpful vote by mail resource from the Brennan Center Heck Ivanka and Jared even voted by mail in this election nbsp Are Democrats trying to steal the election No Counting the votes is not stealing the election Americans cast their votes and now we must wait for them all to be counted nbsp Where can I find the official election results The only official results are those certified by state elections officials While the media can make projections based on ballots counted versus outstanding state election officials are the authorities So if you re not sure about a victory claim you re seeing in the media or from candidates check back with the local officials

predicting that it could take up to a week or more to get the final unofficial vote tallies in many states The NYTimes has a really helpful chart that explains what to expect in each state The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail in ballots which some states are not allowed to start counting until the polls close For example Pennsylvania will not start

counting them all takes time due to the robust security measures in place nbsp But we ve never had an election where ballots weren t all counted on election night FALSE On election night experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have Given that so many votes may still be uncounted on election night it should not alarm anyone if experts decide to hold on making projections It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available by the end of the week We just have to wait for it nbsp Okay but counting votes after election night will steal the election FALSE Ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day and many states require that they must be

deal with Pennsylvania Why are so many people alarmed Experts are anticipating a red mirage in Pennsylvania that could later be subject to a blue shift You can read a really detailed explanation here Essentially though Pennsylvania will count the in person Election Day vote first and that vote is expected to favor President Trump Mail in ballots will be counted later which should favor Biden This means that on election night Trump could lead in Pennsylvania by several points but a significant portion of the vote will still be uncounted It s possible that we could see a significant shift in the days following Similarly in Arizona you could see a red shift where the initial vote favors Biden because the early votes are counted first and Election Day votes are counted later All of this is to say We need to wait for all the votes to be counted before calling the winner nbsp Are mail in ballots rife with fraud No Mail in ballots are very secure Colorado is almost completely vote by mail and has some of the most secure elections in the country Check out this helpful vote by mail resource from the Brennan Center Heck Ivanka and Jared even voted by mail in this election nbsp Where can I

global spread of COVID 19 here The CDC is tracking US cases here Daily situation report from the WHO The CDC s COVID 19 Situation Summary nbsp Reputable Sources for Information The CDC s Dedicated Coronavirus Resource The WHO s Dedicated Coronavirus Resource The University of Chicago School of Medicine s handy FAQ style resource nbsp Here are some of the answers to the most frequently asked questions we re seeing on the subreddit Please note that the University of Chicago Med resource contains more questions and answers than what we ve copy here nbsp What is a coronavirus What is a novel coronavirus A coronavirus is the name for a large set of illnesses including the common cold and other respiratory infections The term novel coronavirus means it s a new form of the virus The 2019 novel coronavirus has been named SARS CoV 2 and the disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID 19 nbsp How does the COVID 19 spread This virus is highly transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before someone develops symptoms It s carried on respiratory droplets when we talk sneeze and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone s mouth or nose When it comes to respiratory droplets 6 feet is the magic distance That s how far these tiny infected droplets can travel Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID 19 When droplets land on surfaces we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes mouth and nose when we touch our faces This is why hand hygiene is so important Good hand hygiene means washing our hands not just after we re using the restroom or before we re eating but regularly throughout the day Respiratory secretions like snot and sputum may also be infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes use disposable tissues throw them away when you re done and wash your hands afterward Keep your work surfaces clean and wipe off your keyboard and your phone nbsp What are the symptoms of COVID 19 Is it deadly Most people who become infected with the virus have mild symptoms and may not know they are sick Others get flu like symptoms Some patients particularly adults over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions develop a severe form of pneumonia which can lead to death If you are experiencing symptoms it is important to know when to see a doctor Patients develop symptoms like fever body aches cough shortness of breath and sore throat about 5 6 days after infection We have recently learned that some people have the unusual symptom of losing their sense of smell which affects taste as well This seems to be temporary and eventually goes away Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own Some people won t get as sick but it s still important not to be out and about so as not to spread the disease A minority of patients will get worse instead of better This usually occurs after 5 7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough If this happens it s time to contact your doctor again or go to an urgent care center or emergency room Be sure to call first so they know you are coming nbsp Is everyone at risk for catching COVID 19 Yes It doesn t appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there s no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them unless they recently had the virus However children appear to be among those least likely to have a bad outcome from contracting the disease The lack of previous experience with this virus is part of the reason public health officials are working so hard to contain and slow the spread of this particular coronavirus When viruses are both new which means the population is highly susceptible and can easily pass from person to person a high transmission rate they can be very dangerous nbsp Why do some people with the COVID 19 get sicker than others It looks like only about 20 of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized The other 80 get what feels like a bad cold or flu and recover at home in about a week A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions but even healthy people can get pretty sick People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection because of their age or chronic health conditions are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID 19 We don t understand why some healthy people get better easily and others get so sick they need oxygen or even a ventilator to help them breathe but we are learning more every day If you have COVID 19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better you should contact your doctor or visit an emergency room Be sure to call first so they know to expect you nbsp Who are the most at risk for contracting a severe case of COVID 19 The most vulnerable populations for having a bad outcome with COVID 19 including needing to be in the hospital or on a ventilator are people over the age of 60 especially men but we don t really understand why with additional medical concerns This includes people who are smokers who have hypertension high blood pressure diabetes low immune systems and underlying lung disease or those who take medicines to suppress their immune systems because they have some sort of autoimmune condition or cancer We strongly recommend that these individuals begin curtailing all of their outdoor activities in accordance with the recent CDC guidelines These people should not be traveling and they should not be out in crowds They should be staying home as much as possible And if you haven t been instructed to work from home you should ask about working from home if you are in one of these groups nbsp Are minorities more likely to get COVID 19 We are seeing a higher number of COVID 19 cases among minorities and low income families This most likely reflects the ongoing racial and socioeconomic disparities in healthcare in these communities Low income workers are less likely to be able to work at home Multiple families living in the same house and homelessness also contribute to the spread of the virus Additionally African Americans are more likely to have health conditions such as diabetes heart disease and high blood pressure and these can be less well controlled than in Caucasians The causes for this are multifactorial but if people in underserved communities are less able to get care for their diabetes they may also be less able to get care for COVID 19 At UChicago Medicine we are committed to caring for each and every person who comes our way especially now during this crisis We are providing the best care possible with world experts in critical care and infectious diseases for all of our patients with COVID 19 nbsp What kind of medical care do patients with COVID 19 need About 20 of COVID 19 patients need to be hospitalized for their pneumonia like illnesses Some of them will require critical care and ventilators special machines that help them breathe And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time It s this portion of patients who continue to be most concerning Many of them will be able to recover with lots of time and support Still a high level of critically ill patients can overwhelm the healthcare systems across our nation pretty quickly Some parts of the US have already been experiencing this Without social distancing it could be much worse We need toPro make sure we slow the spread of COVID so there are enough hospital beds and ventilators for everyone who needs one nbsp How do you screen patients for COVID 19 At UChicago Medicine we are considering anyone with respiratory symptoms fever or any other symptom of COVID 19 as a potential case That means we ask everyone about symptoms when they arrive at the medical center and take appropriate precautions Patients are put into isolation right away and staff wear personal protective equipment like gowns gloves masks and eye shields when they are in the patient s room Patients who need aerosol generating procedures like nebulizer treatments or high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy are placed in rooms with that keep air flowing away from the hallway Many patients don t need to stay in the hospital and are able to isolate at home nbsp What should I do if I think I am infected with COVID 19 We only test people who are sick and occasionally those who are about to undergo important high risk procedures such as an an organ transplant The test to diagnose COVID 19 isn t useful unless you are sick and it s still more limited than any of us want it to be Make sure you tell your doctor about any risks for COVID you may have so they can get you a test if you need it It s also worth mentioning that people shouldn t be worried if they go to their doctor s office and get tested for respiratory viruses and the results say they have a coronavirus That s because coronavirus is the name for a whole group of viruses including things like the common cold Most doctors offices can test for normal everyday coronaviruses If you see test results that say you have one you shouldn t worry If you are being tested for COVID 19 your doctor will be very very specific and will walk you through any results that come back nbsp Can I get tested for COVID 19 if I m worried I ve been exposed Only if you are sick The test to diagnose COVID 19 isn t useful unless you are sick and it s still more limited than any of us want it to be Make sure you tell your doctor about any risks for COVID you may have so they can get you a test if you need it It s also worth mentioning that people shouldn t be worried if they go to their doctor s office and get tested for respiratory viruses and the results say they have a coronavirus That s because coronavirus is the name for a whole group of viruses including things like the common cold Most doctors offices can test for normal everyday coronaviruses If you see test results that say you have one you shouldn t worry If you are being tested for COVID 19 your doctor will be very very specific and will walk you through any results that come back nbsp If I had a mild case of COVID 19 how do I know when I am well Those with mild cases of COVID 19 appear to recover within one to two weeks In severe cases full recovery may take six weeks or more When you no longer have a fever even without taking Tylenol or ibuprofen your cough is gone and you are eating a normal diet again you can be considered well That said it s normal to still feel more tired than usual and it will take some time for you to regain your strength Everyone needs to stay isolated for at least a week After that most experts think it s safe for you to return to work when you have been symptom free for at least 3 full days nbsp If I get COVID 19 and recover will I develop an immunity to it If so how long will it last There is good evidence that most people make antibodies in response to infection and this will provide some protection Limited reports of reinfection are still being investigated and we don t know how good our immune response will be or how long it will last So far it doesn t look like patients are going back to the hospital with another round of infection but even those who recovered early on in Wuhan China have only been well for a few months Experts from University of Chicago Medicine and around the world are working hard to answer this question nbsp Does COVID 19 permanently damage lungs or other organs It s too early to know if the coronavirus has long term effects on lung capacity or if it permanently damages other organs Doctors will be monitoring patients who fully recovered from the virus to see if complications related to having the virus are permanent nbsp What is the status of treatments and a vaccine for COVID 19 For now doctors can only treat the symptoms with supportive care not the virus itself There is no antibiotic these are designed for bacterial infections not viral ones for COVID 19 Scientists are working on a vaccine but we don t expect to have a good vaccine until spring 2021 However ongoing trials at UChicago Medicine and other centers suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients In fact the University of Chicago is part of a multi institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS CoV 2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID 19 We are enrolling patients in trials of remdesivir hydroxychloroquine and even using the antibodies in the blood serum of patients who have recovered to treat currently sick patients \n",

talk sneeze and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone s mouth or nose When it comes to respiratory droplets 6 feet is the magic distance That s how far these tiny infected droplets can travel Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID 19 When droplets land on surfaces we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes mouth and nose when we touch our faces This is why hand hygiene is so important Respiratory secretions like snot and sputum are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes nbsp What are the symptoms of the virus Is it deadly It typically causes flu like symptoms Some patients particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions develop a severe form of pneumonia Patients develop symptoms like fever muscle and body aches cough and sore throat about 5 6 days after infection Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own Some people won t get as sick but it s still important not to be out and about so as not to spread the disease A minority of patients will get worse instead of better This usually happens after 5 7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough If this happens it s time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room Be sure to call first so they know you are coming The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily As of early March there have been over 97 000 confirmed cases with a death toll of about 3 000 more than 2 900 in mainland China But these numbers are just estimates it s still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns nbsp Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus 2019 nCoV Yes It doesn t appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there s no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan When viruses come out like this that are both new which means the population is highly susceptible and can easily pass from person to person a high transmission rate they can be really dangerous even if here s a low percentage of people who die from them nbsp Why do some people with the COVID 19 get sicker than others It looks like only about 20 of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized The other 80 get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection because of their age or chronic health conditions are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID 19 That said some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect We don t understand why that is or what might be different about these patients If you have COVID 19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better you should contact your doctor or visit an ER Be sure to call first so they know to expect you nbsp What kind of medical care do patients with COVID 19 need About 80 of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick but ultimately be just fine It s the 20 of COVID 19 patients who get really really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia like illnesses They typically require critical care and ventilation special machines that help them breathe And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time It s this portion of patients that is most concerning Depending on how many cases develop here in the U S providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation s health care system pretty quickly We can help prevent this kind of surge in patients by practicing social distancing see below for more explanation nbsp Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID 19 There s widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U S But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza You can get an annual flu shot You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you ve been exposed You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread And like clockwork this year s influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course The challenge with COVID 19 is that we probably can t contain it and we don t know if we re really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic If we are lucky it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually nbsp How can I protect myself Should I wear a facemask Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick not touching your eyes nose and mouth washing your hands thoroughly and frequently and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID 19 or other respiratory illnesses Those who have COVID 19 and are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID 19 also should wear a mask nbsp Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus There is no antibiotic they are designed for bacterial infections not viral ones to treat COVID 19 Scientists are already working on a vaccine but we don t expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest However ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients In fact the University of Chicago is part of a multi institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS CoV 2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID 19 For now doctors can only treat the symptoms not the virus itself \n",

novel coronavirus including how easy it is to spread and how dangerous it is But we know the virus can be transmitted from person to person and it is passed by coughing and other close contact Close contact is a vague term that means a lot of things to different people But in this case it specifically means being within about six feet of someone for a prolonged period of time without wearing recommended personal protective equipment such as a disposable face mask It could also be having direct contact with infectious secretions of someone who has a case of the virus for example being

            "---- Rule Changes Coming Out of the Quarterly Feedback Thread ----\n",
            "About a month ago we posted the quarterly moderation feedback thread asking you all for your input on the state of the subreddit and our moderation We read through all the feedback and now we have a few rule changes to announce based on some of the top comments nbsp Rule Change 1 Game Breaking Bugs The most upvoted comment in the thread stated that The next time the game is super buggy could you guys at least leave some thread up on the frontpage that informs people of the situation If you just checked the frontpage of the subreddit it looked like nothing was out of the ordinary while half the runes in the game weren t working crashes were running rampant Annie was permastunning people and a bunch of other crap Nobody wants to have to check the megathread for bug reports and read through it for a while just to realize that the game isn t particularly playable We agree with OP that game breaking bugs are super frustrating and that a megathread for bug reports may not be ideal for users That said the megathread is still really important for the devs who check it regularly after new patches With this in mind we re adding a new bullet under our bug rule which states Game breaking bugs are allowed as their own post provided that the bug is severe enough to be a widespread issue that fundamentally impacts the playability or balance of the game The definition of game breaking is a bit subjective so here are a few examples of the level of impact we are looking for The recent Annie permastun bug The Xerath global ult bug The Riven insta base combo If the bug is not at that level of impact on the game then it will likely be removed and forced into the bug megathread Also we encourage all of you to make sure that all bugs including the game breaking ones still end up in the bug megathread We ll be monitoring the impact of this rule change on the bug megathreads so make sure those don t fall out of style One last note here is that because game breaking is a bit subjective and because the overall impact of a bug may not be immediately apparent moderator enforcement on this one could be inconsistent We re going into this change with eyes wide open on the potential obstacles but we want to give this a try because of the community response With all that in mind please be patient as we work out the kinks and be sure to give us feedback on how we can make this rule in particular function well nbsp Rule Change 2 Server Status Posts The second most upvoted comment was If people are unable to play the game it seems pretty directly related to the game not to mention that the servers running the game are also directly related to the game otherwise they wouldn t be running the game If a lot of people have the same problem I wanna know how widespread that problem is and I don t want to go to new for that and find out how many posts have been created that haven t been deleted yet As a result of this feedback we have removed the previous server status rule that said Posts about the status of servers issues related to the servers and network issues are not allowed The new rule is User posts about the status of servers are allowed but only if the issue is confirmed by Riot The post will be removed once the server issues are resolved Duplicate posts about server issues will be removed under our existing repost rule nbsp Rule Change 3 Post Match Threads PMTs and Tournaments Another request we saw was around PMTs and game day rules This comment sums up the feedback pretty well I can t stand the change where you remove post match discussions after 24 hours well typically it seems to be less than that Post match discussions are my favorite aspect of this sub and even if they fill up the front page it s quality content so why suppress it Can you at least include a sidebar link to all of the week s post match discussions Well RealFatChicken we have since implemented an archive on the sidebar so that request is already answered Buuuut we have even better news for you esports fans Before we get to the better news though some context is necessary so everyone can understand the change A few months ago we implemented game day rules to help deal with the flood of esports content that happens on game days which is roughly 4 days a week every week Fri Sun games followed by posts sticking around through Monday Under these rules a bot removes LCS and LEC PMTs after 15 hours and then reapproves them after 40 hours in order to free up the first second and third pages of the subreddit for new content Removed PMTs are still available throughout this time via the live discussion threads and the new archive in the sidebar Now for that better news for you esports lovers We re updating our game day rules to exempt PMTs from being removed during quarterfinals semi finals and finals matches in LCS LEC as well as International tournaments like MSI and Worlds This change should keep all the hype that comes with these big matches while still keeping the subreddit fresh during the rest of the year That s all for now \n",

            "Hi Everyone We ve been listening to all the feedback we ve received over the last few months and now we re ready to announce a few changes that have been driven by all of you There are three big rule changes here so make sure to read through them all Loosening our Meme Rule Previously we had a zero tolerance rule for memes However after reading thread after thread after thread about the issues with this enforcement we ve decided to run a trial change For the next month we will be running a trial where our meme rule is loosened to allow high quality original content that references memes for inspiration Here are a few examples of memes that have been removed in the past but would be allowed now under this new rule Morgana and Kayle Purrrgot Urgette The updated rule is as follows Memes with League of Legends text or images imposed over a template are not allowed Post this content on Fanart or videos that originate from memes that are remade in their entirety are permitted Copycat posts such as MS Paint drawings front page topics reposted with slight changes and other similar posts may be removed Under this rule we will still be removing actual memes and content that includes memetic content The key here is that the content must be remade in its entirety so including clipped or cut and pasted memes in your video will still get it removed One more thing Our meme title rule remains as is Vague contextless memetic or inaccurate titles are not allowed Titles should represent or describe the content of a post If your title contains memes your post will be removed nbsp Short Duration Videos 15 Second Rule Last month we announced that we were trialing a reduction in our short duration video rule after feedback we received in our quarterly thread Previously we required all videos under 30 seconds to be put into text posts but during the trial we reduced that requirement to 15 seconds We re happy to report that the change is now permanent This means that videos 15 seconds or longer can be posted directly to the subreddit while those shorter than 15 seconds will still need to be posted in a text post Please note that padding your video to make it hit the threshold will lead to it being removed nbsp Character Requirement Changes Personal stories now require 750 characters down from 1 000 characters Tweets now require 250 characters up from 215 Changing the character requirement was inspired in part by feedback from and subreddit meta on our discord Essentially people felt 1 000 characters was just too long and that a reduction would be appropriate After some discussion we went with a slight loosening to 750 characters For twitter there are two reasons for this change The first is that twitter increased the max character count on their tweets to 280 yes we know it happened ages ago While most tweets we see here don t go that high we felt it was enough to make a minor adjustment So then why 250 Mostly for consistency s sake It s hard to remember a bunch of different numbers for character requirements so we wanted to streamline it with other rules both for our own ease of enforcement but also for users That s all for now Please let us know what you think of these changes and hit us up with any questions you might have \n",

            "Hi Everyone World s best mod here to tell you about some recent rule updates Buckle up and read closely Short Duration Videos We ll be trialling a pretty big change to our short duration video rule over the next month Up until now our rule required that all videos under 30 seconds be posted in a text post For the next month we re lowering that threshold to 15 seconds That means that videos that are 15 seconds long will be allowed as direct posts on the subreddit while those under 15 seconds still need to be posted in text posts We re running this as a trial because the original rule was meant to combat spam and ensure higher quality video content We want to allow great content but we don t want to open the floodgates for spam and a frontpage flooded with low quality videos At the end of the trial our team will determine if the change is permanent or if the rule will be reverted to the 30 second requirement nbsp NSFW Rule You all are some dirty motherfuckers so we re updating our NSFW rule to include a new bullet point Posts that engage in casual sexism or sexual objectification are not allowed This includes posts that compare the thigh gaps boobs or asses of champions and other similar submissions And yes that means that the other aspects of our NSFW rule are very much still in effect You still can t post your nasty lux erotica to the sub you still can t share your drawings and you still can t post lingerie cosplay nbsp Direct Address Rule We already posted about this update to our enforcement last week I m not going to rewrite the entire post here but the TL DR is that we are loosening our direct address rule to allow implicit addresses and we ll be treating them like feature suggestions Don t know what all that means then click this link and read the more detailed post And finally Zoe is a disaster of a champion She should be deleted from the game \n",
