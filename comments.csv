ArPwVn988LA,Swanage Railway: Herston Carriage Shed Appeal,"We need your help to raise the final £65,000 required to complete the Herston Carriage Shed and turn our vision for undercover accommodation for our carriage fleet into a reality. 

Our carriages are currently stored outside and exposed to the elements all year round. This new covered accommodation is urgently required to help protect some of the Swanage Railway's most historic and valuable carriages, the oldest of which is over 80 years old! The irreplaceable vehicles will significantly benefit from protection against the weather to increase the intervals between overhauls while also reducing the time and expense associated with their maintenance.

In early 2020 we launched an appeal which raised £30,000, alongside this we started foundation work on site. Fundraising was paused in March 2020 and our focus instead switched to the Save Our Service Appeal, launched to mitigate against the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic and ensure our railway survived through the winter.

We are now in a position to return to the Herston carriage shed project. Thanks to successful fund-raising efforts as well as generous legacies and bequests, we have already raised £177,000 towards the building costs. 

We had hoped to secure a grant to part-fund the construction but owing to Covid-19 this was no longer available. Without the grant, because of the early closure of the original appeal and allowing for inflation, we need your help to raise the final £65,000 by the end of June. If we meet this target, the steel structure of the carriage shed can be manufactured and installed on the site in November, enabling us to complete the new shed in early 2022.

This could not have been possible without your generous support! Our Save Our Service appeal has raised over £330,000 and is now within touching distance of our target we set out in April. When we launched the initial SOS campaign, we set out to raise £360,000 to help us survive. Now we’re counting down, with less than £30,000 to go, the goal is tantalising close.

COVID-19 measures including social distancing are expected to continue into next year and the impact of the pandemic are expected affect us afterwards too so there's no room for complacency. We still need your support to reach this target.

Any money we can raise is absolutely vital, particularly over the winter months, as the revenue that we have gained from our limited operating season cannot fix the damage done by COVID-19 thus far. The SOS appeal is essential to help us bridge that gap. Any donations large or small would be of great help to our railway in these uncertain times – thank you!

Thanks to many extremely generous donations over £187,405 has been raised so far but, considering we would normally have started running daily services by now, this will not yet recuperate our loss of revenue.

Despite nearly all of our staff being furloughed, the railway will still incur overhead costs such as rent for the station buildings and the leased track bed. The effects of COVID-19 are already having a financial impact and will continue to do so, potentially for years to come.

All of the profits gained during the operating season are reinvested back into the Swanage Railway throughout the year and particularly during a winter break for the essential maintenance of the trains, facilities and infrastructure. The railway’s insurance however does not cover pandemics, so as each day passes without income that cash reserve diminishes, but this essential work still has to take place. It is therefore vital we fight for the railway’s survival.

The last British Rail train ran to Corfe Castle and Swanage in January 1972.

Shortly after, the line was closed and the tracks were ripped up, leaving only a three-mile stub from the main line to Furzebrook for clay and later Wytch Farm for oil.

Few people thought that passenger trains from Swanage and Corfe Castle would ever return to Wareham, but 45 years later the towns have been reconnected.

The first public train from Swanage to Wareham ran again on Tuesday 13th June 2017, departing at 10:23am. The service was top and tailed by Class 33 ""Crompton"" No. 33012 / D6515 ""Lt Jenny Lewis RN"" which hauled the service from Swanage to Wareham, and Class 37 No. 37518. which hauled the train back to Swanage.
